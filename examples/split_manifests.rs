//! While it's simplest to simply define all elements of the manifest in a single file, it's also possible to split the manifest into multiple files.
//!
//! This can be useful to reduce merge conflicts in a team environment, keep things organized,
//! allow for more modular content creation by grouping the content into smaller files,
//! or reduce the amount of data that needs to be loaded into memory at once.
//!
//!
//! This example showcases a simple pattern for loading manifests from multiple files.
