//! While manifests are typically defined once and then used throughout the lifetime of the application,
//! there are cases where you may want to dynamically generate or modify a manifest at runtime.
//!
//! For example, you may be working with user-generated content, have a modding system that allows players to add new content to the game,
//! or simply have more content than you can fit into memory at once.
//!
//! By mutating the contents of our manifest at runtime, we can add (and remove!) game objects to the game world as needed.
